                        <img src="./img/esv01.png" alt="Picture of a man walking to the ocean at a sunny beach" />
                    </span>
                    <p>Inspired by Miley Cyrus' album "Endless Summer Vacation" and the celebration of my first year
                        abroad,
                        I planned my return to Sicily with this special vacation trip with my friend, Jessy</p>
                    <p>For the first time in my life I experienced winter for real. I saw everything around me lose its
                        colors, vitality and energy. Everything seemed cold and apathetic.</p>
                    <p>But luckily now is also the first time I experience the end of such a severe period and of course
                        I
                        will celebrate accordingly! My adaptation period is over, I already understood the rules of the
                        game
                        for those who navigate "alone", so now I'm going to throw myself into this amazing world and
                        face my
                        first summer by myself.</p>
                    <p>Let's see the flowers bloom, feel the sun kiss our face, walk hand in hand along the beach, feel
                        the
                        breeze through the car window and take a beautiful restorative dip in the blue sea. Jumping in
                        the
                        pool, wearing little clothes, listening to the click of flip-flops along the way. Starting the
                        party
                        when the sun goes down and only going home after it rises again on the horizon. I'll even do
                        some
                        exercises in the morning, are you up for it?</p>
                    <p>Grab your guitar, let's sing the songs that remind us of our roots. See the movement and flirt
                        with
                        the crowd as if we were rock stars. Make lifelong friendships that will become strangers before
                        the
                        next season begins. Dance like no one cares until the body is warmed up, then we have a nice
                        drink
                        of a cold beer and it's all over. Let's sail through the sea and through the unknown within us.
                    </p>
                    <p>If we sit at a table with a deck of cards, the night will turn into day before we finish. I can
                        already feel my cheeks hurting from laughing so much. I already feel laziness wrapped in the
                        swing
                        of a hammock.</p>
                    <span class="esv-img" style="float: right; transform: rotate(6deg);">
                        <img src="./img/esv02.png" alt="Picture of a man smiling with sunglasses" />
                    </span>
                    <p>And I know that one day winter will return, friendships will drift away, love will end and
                        routine
                        will occupy us until we have a new prosperous moment of freedom. But until then, let's make this
                        summer our endless vacation, leaving unforgettable memories like tattoos on our skin.</p>
                    <p>Let's live not as if each day were our last one (we know that this is unlikely to be true), but
                        with
                        the certainty that even if other moments like this happen, they will never be repeated.
                        Everything
                        is finite, even if it seems eternal. The sun is likely to shine and touch our skin tomorrow as
                        it
                        did today, but it is unlikely that I am here and you are with me. So let's live those details
                        that
                        make each minute special for the set of small miracles that make it up.</p>
                    <p>Next summer won't be like this one, just like this one won't be like the last. We're becoming
                        masters
                        at making each moment unique, aren't we? Or maybe we're just getting older and recognizing that
                        everything changes, that life's cycles push us forward as much as they bring the past to the
                        surface
                        to confront us and show us how much we've evolved - without losing humility and recognizing how
                        much
                        we can still get better. The way is to make peace with both: the past and the future (only then
                        will
                        we won't go crazy).</p>
                    <p>We are no longer the same. Does it scare you or comfort you?</p>
                    <p>I'm ready for an unforgettable journey. And you, do you already know which story you want to tell
                        about this summer?</p>
